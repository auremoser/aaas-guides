# Goal-setting

Short Link : https://mzl.la/mozgoals

The objective of this exercise is to define a few key goals and areas of improvement over your next 10 months as a Mozilla Fellow.

## PART I: Setting Goals

Let's start with some time-travel.

Imagine it's June, you're wrapping up your fellowship and about to attend the final fellows dinner with your cohort and potentially the fellows from concurrent cohorts.

How would you like to be remembered?

Think of the following three areas of development:

### 1. Professional + Personal

* Where do you want to be in your career? 
* What type of work would you like to be doing?
* Where do you want to go from here?

Write one goal from these reflection questions. Transfer your goal to a post-it.

### 2. Collaborative + Community-wide

* What contacts would you like to build or maintain?
* Who or what can Mozilla connect you with before you graduate?
* What domains, industries, or disciplines would you like to collaborate with through your future work?

Write one goal from these reflection questions. Transfer your goal to a post-it.

### 3. Educational + Academic

* What skills do you want to learn for your job?
* If you were to pursue (more) formal education, what would it be (continuing ed course, MOOC, academic degree...)?

Write one goal from these reflection questions. Transfer your goal to a post-it.

## PART II: Team Up

Get into small groups of 4 or 5 people. Add your post-its to the same pool of postits in each of these areas of development (professional/personal, collaborative/community, educational/academic). 

Discuss these goals; find at least on goal per person that connects to another goal in the pool (not one of yours). Cluster these goals together.

Break down the year into 10 months, and discuss where your goals fall in that timeline.

## PART III: Identifing your heros

Think about one (or two) people you admire, write down their name and admirable qualities, in each of the three areas of development listed above.

Brainstorm ways you can connect with this person...either directly by meeting/communicating with them, or abstractly by meeting them at their level, and emulating their qualities.

On a post-it, write the name, and title (if not obvious) of one of the people you admire, and discuss this person with your group. Write on the back of your post-it what they achieved that inspires you to achieve your personal goals.

Add these post-its to the group goal board.

## PART IV: Document it all

Break up into groups or work on your own. On a sheet of paper, or in a text editor:

* write down your 3 goals, identified in the previous two parts of this exercise
* apply these goals to the "[open canvas](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/open_canvas/)" model
	* define at least two more specific steps to achieving each of these goals (6 steps in total, two for each goal)
	* list one person that can help you achieve each goal (maybe another fellow, mozilla staff member, or one of your "heros")
	* what does success look like for your goals?
	* what is your 10 month plan for achieving these goals

Keep this document, refer to it throughout your fellowship. We'll revisit it in the future.
